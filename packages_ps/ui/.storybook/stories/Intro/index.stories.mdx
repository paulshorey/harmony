## This is not a UI Component Library...

**It's a starter kit for easily maintianing <span className="colors-accent">your own</span> <span className="colors-rainbow"> custom-branded </span> UI library.**

<br />

## A UI development kit for enterprise.

**Maintainable** - Great developer experience. Easily manage media queries, variables, colors,Â markup, and interactive functionality.  
**Mono-repo** - Maintain just one set of components and styles. Import into multiple apps.  
**Extensible** - Add functionality and style to the base library as a "variant". Then select that variant in your app. This way if you need to customize a component, you don't have to duplicate code, but can build on top of the base component - without affecting other apps.

<br />

## CSS-in-JS is no longer tedious:

- <a href="/">media queries</a> - easily style breakpoints with JSX props, JS variables,
  or a Styled Component (HOC)
- <a href="/">variants and variables</a> - use/extend multiple predefined variants
  (like classNames but with Typescript)

<br />

## Compatible with most component libraries.

### Peer dependencies:

- React
- Typescript
- Next (optional, required for variants that use next/link)
- @emotion/styled (same as styled-components)
- @emotion/react (to load global styles and theme)

<br />

## Putting the "C" back into "CSS"...

The "C" in "CSS" stands for "Cascading" - styles can be applied based on parent/grandparent styles/variables. Unfortunately, this is lost in modern "CSS-in-JS" solutions. They should be called "S-in-JS", but that's not as catchy. ðŸ˜†

This library attempts to bring back inheritance to style rules, but without the class name conflicts. Components should be able to know if they are inside a dark theme or on top of a color gradient, and adjust the text/button colors automatically. Using CSS variables and HTML data attributes, components are able to adapt to their surroundings, without the developer having to set a specific color shade and subtle style rules for each instance of a component

It's a work in progress. This library is not ready for production use yet, but so far it's looking promising! ðŸš€ Now testing and optimizing.
