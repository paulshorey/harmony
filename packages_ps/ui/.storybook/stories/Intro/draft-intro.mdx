There are many UI component libraries out there, especially for React. But they all have limitations. <a>Here's a comparison.</a> Building your own is a big investment and can get messy. Not anymore!

<Code
variant="transparentDark"
code={`import Span from '@ps/ui/components/content/Span';
...

{' '}

<Span variant="textGradient" data-color="accent">
  your own
</Span> <Span variant="textColorUnderline" data-color="rainbow">
  {' '}
  custom branded{' '}
</Span>
`} caption=
{
  <>
    Easy!{' '}
    <a href="/?path=/docs/about-200--page" target="_top">
      Read about the Media Query shortcuts!
    </a>
  </>
}
/>

<Code
  variant="transparentLight"
  prismTheme={{ plain: { backgroundColor: 'beige' } }}
  code={`<Code 
  variant="transparentDark" 
  code={\`import Span from '@ps/ui/components/content/Span';
  ...
  <Span variant="textGradient" data-color="accent">your own</Span> <Span variant="textColorUnderline" data-color="rainbow"> custom branded </Span>
  \`}
  caption={<>Easy! And wait till you <a href="/?path=/docs/about-200--page" target="_top">read about the Media Query shortcuts!</a></>}
/>`}
  caption="Here is how the previous component was rendered"
/>

## Compatible with most component libraries.

**Peer dependencies:**

- React
- Typescript
- @emotion/styled (just like styled-components)
- @emotion/react (load global styles and theme)
- Next (optional, required for components that use next/link) \*/}

## Putting the "C" back into "CSS"...

The "C" in "CSS" stands for "Cascading" - styles can be applied based on parent/grandparent styles/variables. Unfortunately, this is lost in modern "CSS-in-JS" solutions. They should be called "S-in-JS", but that's not as catchy. ðŸ˜†

This library attempts to bring back inheritance to style rules, but without the class name conflicts. Components should be able to know if they are inside a dark theme or on top of a color gradient, and adjust the text/button colors automatically. Using CSS variables and HTML data attributes, components are able to adapt to their surroundings, without the developer having to set a specific color shade and subtle style rules for each instance of a component

It's a work in progress. This library is not ready for production use yet, but so far it's looking promising! ðŸš€ Now testing and optimizing.
