# All the functions you could ever need

> If something is missing, just add it!

## Folder structure

- browser - relies on the window, location, user agent, OS, screen size, etc.
- io - pure functions, no side effects, immutable, input/output
- requests - real external HTTP calls (APIs)
- server - relies on server-side dependencies and variables like process/env/fs

**Inside each of those are other folders (categories)**
Inside that, are the files. There's index, test, and of course the functions.

category -> functionality -> file
