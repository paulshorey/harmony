# Spiral Web Monorepo

This repo houses Spiral's web apps in one place to easily facilitate code sharing, global code standards, and a consistent developer experience.

## Notes

- **To install a new NPM package for one of the apps/packages, run `yarn add -W <package-name>` while inside the app/package directory.** _This will install the package in the root `node_modules` folder and symlink it to the app/package that needs it. This is a clever way to avoid duplicate packages in the `node_modules` folder._

## What's inside?

This [turborepo](https://turborepo.org) uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

```
cd WebMonorepo
yarn lint
```

To lint and format a single app or package, run the following command:

```
cd apps/*
yarn lint
yarn format
```

### Using Spiral Packages

Packages may be shared between all apps/packages in the repo. It's important to note that any global package changes may affect other apps.

All packages follow this naming syntax: `@ps/*package-name`

#### To include a package to your app, include it in your `package.json` dependencies like so:

```
"dependencies": {
    "@ps/ui": "*",
    ...
 }
```

#### To use a Spiral package, simply import your needed file:

```
import Button from '@ps/ui/src/components/common/atoms/Button'
...

```

#### To use a Spiral config package:

```
module.exports = require('@ps/config/prettier-preset');
```

## Committing To The Repo

This repo uses [Commit Lint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) to enforce commit syntax in the following format:

```
type: build chore ci docs feat fix perf refactor revert style test
scope (app/package): cms consumer nonprofit ui utils config
message: your git commit message
issue (Jira issue): SW2-123
```

This means that to commit you must add a commit message matching this format:

```
type(scope): message (SW2-1234)

ie. feat(consumer): added new feature (SW2-123)
```

Also included is a yarn script that can be run from the root of the app to walk you through:

```
yarn commit

```

## Core Branches üìç

Each app has core branches used to facilitate moving code from integration to QA/Staging to production environments.

### Summary

Code needed for each app stage will flow like this:

`integration` ‚û°Ô∏è `*app-staging` ‚û°Ô∏è `*app*-uat` ‚û°Ô∏è `*app*-production`

Every time we merge from `integration` a "snapshot" of the repo at that time will be available on the next branch.

This allows us to continually develop on integration as a team, while ensuring no unexpected code changes are made to a higher tier branch (staging/uat/prod).

### Shared By All (Trunk Branch)

- `integration`

### Consumer Banking

- `consumer-staging`
- `consumer-uat`
- `consumer-production-rollback`
- `consumer-production`

### Nonprofit Banking

- `nonprofit-staging`
- `nonprofit-uat`
- `nonprofit-production-rollback`
- `nonprofit-production`

### CMS

- `cms-staging`
- `cms-uat`
- `cms-production-rollback`
- `cms-production`

## Deployment üöÄ

Our deployment process involves generating a changelog, a unique version, and escalating those changes through our development stages/environments.

Note: Integration branch is our [trunk](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/branch-for-release/) branch which all code committed to the repository enters through. From there, code may be merged into any of the core branches or a feature branch as needed.

We should avoid making direct commits or PRs to any other branch and instead cherry-pick as needed.

For detailed deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT](https://github.com/SpiralFinancial/WebMonorepo/DEPLOY.md)


## Deploying To Amplify

Below is an example build script used by Amplify.

        files:
          - '**/*'
      cache:
        paths:
          - apps/consumer/node_modules/**/*
          - apps/consumer/.next/cache/**/*
