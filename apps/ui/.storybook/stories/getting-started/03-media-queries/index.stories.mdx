## Every app needs to style for different screen sizes.

Material UI gives us `sm`,`md`,`lg`,`xl` breakpoints which use `min-width` media queries to target increasingly larger screen sizes. üëç But what if I need to style only `(min-width: 768px) and (max-width:1024px)` or another specific device that's not preconfigured? Sometimes I need to add fixes for extra-narrow phones. ü§î Mobile-first is a great guideline, but is very limiting when enforced as a rule.

Chakra UI's styled-system adds a shortcut to that approach - pass an array of css props to style all 4 breakpoints in one command. Like: `<Box p={['10px','12px','15px','30px']]}>`. üòé Cool, but inconsistent because you'll very rarely actually style all breakpoints at the same time. And now I have to remember sizes by a few predefined index numbers. Plus all those clever style props pollute the namespace with all other React props that pass data/logic. <!--Developers have been working for decades to solve namespace pollution. Seems like a step backwards. ü§Æ-->

<Block as="h2" textgradient="rainbow" ss="margin-top: 2.75rem;">But such attempts at simplicity can make maintenance more difficult.</Block>

This library takes a slightly different approach. Semantic prop names. Instead of "xs, sm, md, lg" this offers "smallPhone, phone, tablet, largeTablet, desktop, largeDesktop, extraLargeDesktop". Also "portrait" and "landscape", "webview" and "iframe", etc. There are a few pairs to make it even easier: `phone` vs `notPhone` for min/max 600px, `sm` vs `lg` styles for min/max 930px, and `mobile` vs `desktop` for min/max 1024px.
