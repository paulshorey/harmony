<Block as="h2" textgradient="rainbow" ss="margin-top: 0;">Every app needs to style for different screen sizes.</Block>

Material UI gives us `sm`,`md`,`lg`,`xl` breakpoints which use `min-width` media queries to target increasingly larger screen sizes. üëç But what if I need to style only `(min-width: 768px) and (max-width:1024px)` or another specific device that's not preconfigured? Sometimes I need to add fixes for extra-narrow phones. ü§î Mobile-first is a great guideline, but edge cases will lead to messy code.

Chakra UI's styled-system adds a shortcut to that approach - pass an array of css props to style all 4 breakpoints in one command. Like: `<Box p={['10px','12px','15px','30px']]}>`. üòé Cool, but inconsistent because you'll very rarely actually style all breakpoints at the same time. And now I have to remember sizes by a few predefined index numbers. Plus all those clever style props pollute the namespace with all other React props that pass data/logic. <!--Developers have been working for decades to solve namespace pollution. Seems like a step backwards. ü§Æ-->

<Block as="h2" textgradient="rainbow" ss="margin-top: 2.75rem;">But such attempts at simplicity can make maintenance more difficult.</Block>

This library takes a slightly different approach. Semantic prop names. Instead of "xs, sm, md, lg" this offers "smallPhone, phone, tablet, largeTablet, desktop, largeDesktop, extraLargeDesktop".
