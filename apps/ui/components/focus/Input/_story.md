Right now, this component uses Ant Design's Input component. See: <a href="https://ant.design/components/input/" target="_blank">https://ant.design/components/input</a>. Please note: this library does NOT include any Ant design CSS. It's a large stylesheet. Instead, this library includes just one individual tree-shaken React component as needed, then adds a few custom styles. This results in a bundle size as small as if this component was built completely in house.

In the future, this component could use a different library or just plain HTML elements. Any apps that use this component will not need to change their implementations.
