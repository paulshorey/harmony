Uses component from `antd/lib/input` with all the same props. See documentation: https://ant.design/components/input/. BUT, this does not import any Ant CSS. Includes only custom locally scoped CSS to minimize bundle size and avoid specificity issues when rebranding.  
Not finished yet. If something is unstyled, please open an issue <a>on Github</a>.
