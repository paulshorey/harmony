Right now, this component uses Ant Design's Input component. Please ignore the classNames prefixed with "ant-".

In the future, this component may decide to use a different library, or simply the standard HTML input element. Any apps that use this component will not need to change their implementations. That is the beauty of abstracting away management of components to a library. When changing a component used in multiple apps, you'll only need to do it once.
