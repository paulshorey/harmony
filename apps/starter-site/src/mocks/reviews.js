      'I’m a giver who donates when something inspires me. That leaves me with donations out of multiple accounts and poor record keeping. With the Spiral app, I search for my charity, donate and within seconds my donation is on it’s way. This provides me the ability to keep all of my donations in one place.\n\nWonderful, simplistic and easy to use. Love it!',
