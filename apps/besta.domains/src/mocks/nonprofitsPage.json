Banking services that Spiral provides to customers are offered under an agreement with nbkc Bank of Overland Park, Kansas and are FDIC insured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of this agreement is to encourage our customers to give to <strong>[Nonprofit]</strong> <meta charset=\"utf-8\">(below referred to as “you” or “your”) and provide them the opportunity to follow your work by sharing content and information about your achievements and other activities. It also helps speed up our transfer of matching donations to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To advance this purpose, this partnership agreement between Spiral Financial Inc and <strong>[Nonprofit]</strong> is entered into and goes into effect when we notify you at your email address that we accept you into the Spiral Giving Network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This service is free. You will not be charged any fees by us as part of this agreement or the services we provide to promote your nonprofit. We do not charge any transaction fees on donations — we pass 100% to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Our commitment to share your content</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To promote your nonprofit, we will share content about your work and achievements with our customers and the broader world. We may share content through our mobile application, website or social media pages. We are constantly expanding and improving our products and the ways in which your content will be presented to our customers may change accordingly. Here are some of the ways your content may be shared:<ul><li>An enhanced profile for our customers detailing your work with relevant images or videos</li><li>Cards on customers’ Spiral home feeds detailing the impact of your nonprofit</li><li>Your name and logo on our featured nonprofits list<br>       </li></ul></li><li>We will generate the content described above using public materials from your website.

For some donations, we directly send the donation from the customer’s giving account to you. We also pass donations through a 501(c)(3) donor advised fund (“DAF”), which provides some additional protections for our customers and enables more efficient processing. You may receive donations either way as a partner. For both methods, we do not deduct any transaction fees from our customers in connection with their donations and pass 100% of their donation amount to you. You will be eligible for our donation matching through either method.<br></li><li>If we are processing donations through a DAF, here is how it works. The DAF has a mission to support nonprofits across the United States. The DAF receives donations from our customers with instructions of which nonprofit to benefit from their donation. The DAF then performs due diligence on that nonprofit and, if the nonprofit passes, sends those donations on to the nonprofit. Our designated DAF partner is Hub of Love. We will notify you if we partner with another DAF in the future or there are other changes to how we process donations.<br></li><li>We will share with you an organized list of donors on a regular basis (unless they have chosen to remain anonymous).<br></li><li>When donations are sent directly, you will need to send a charitable receipt to the donor (unless they have chosen to remain anonymous). When we process donations through a DAF, you do not need to send a charitable receipt to the donor, but you are welcome to send an acknowledgement.
