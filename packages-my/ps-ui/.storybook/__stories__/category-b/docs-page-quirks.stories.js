              Mistica comes with builtin support for the different Telefonica
              brand color schemes. Use the theme selector in the toolbar above
              to switch between the supported themes (Telef√≥nica, Movistar, O2,
              Blau and Vivo)
            </p>

              For quick prototyping using Mistica components, use the{' '}
              <a href="/playroom">Mistica Playroom</a>. Using the Playroom you
              can simultaneously design across a variety of themes and screen
              sizes, powered by JSX and Mistica components library. It's the
              perfect tool to create quick mock-ups and interactive prototypes
              with real code. It also allows you to share your work with others
              by simply copying the URL.
